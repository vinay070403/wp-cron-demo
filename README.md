## Description

 ## Frequently Asked Questions 

= How often does the email get sent? =
By default, every 2 minutes (you can change it in the code).

= Can I change the recipient email? =
Yes, open the plugin file and replace the `$to` email address.

= Will this work if my site has low traffic? =
WordPress cron jobs are traffic-dependent. If you want exact scheduling,
you may need to set up a real server cron job to call `wp-cron.php`.

## üïí Scheduled Actions / Cron Jobs

This plugin uses WordPress Action Scheduler to handle background tasks.

A cron event action_scheduler_run_queue is scheduled automatically.

This ensures queued actions (like background processing, API sync, etc.) run without affecting page load.

The original cron event is not modified, only additional tasks are scheduled when required.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If Action Scheduler is disabled or WP-Cron is turned off, some background tasks may not run.
